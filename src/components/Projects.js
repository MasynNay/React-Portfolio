                          This was my very first coding project. I wanted to be
                          able to have my betta fish, Vendetta, play a Pokemon
                          game. I got my inspiration from "FishPlaysPokemon"
                          that was on Twitch.tv in 2014. This was a very fun
                          project to work on and a great starting point for a
                          coder's journey! The video provided were the only
                          remaining clips I could find of this project. I hope
                          you enjoy.
